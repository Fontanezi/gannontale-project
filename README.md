# GannonTale Project
GannonTale is a short dialogue-based game focused on explaining how space weather can impact life on earth through the eyes of a CME (Gannon Storm) and the citizens of a small city.

Project GannonTale is a short browser game. It runs on native HTML, CSS and Javascript, hosted on Github. 

The goal is to have an accessible and comprehensive tool that students on all levels can use to understand what space weather is and how it can affect people on earth. With that scope in mind, we decided to create a game, a media type that most students are familiar and engaged with. Inspired in the late 90's and 2000's RPG games, GannonTale conveys the impacts and importance of space weather by showing situations and consequences to the player, rather than just explaining the phenomenon.

For creating the game, the Phaser engine was used. Phaser is a Desktop and Mobile HTML5 game framework. A fast, free and fun open source framework for Canvas and WebGL powered browser games.

The game assets were created using Tiled, a map editor tool, as well as some smaller media conversion tools and tweaks made by hand.
